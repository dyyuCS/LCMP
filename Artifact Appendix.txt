\section{Artifact Appendix} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Abstract}
This artifact contains the complete implementation and evaluation framework for LCMP, a novel routing scheme for inter-datacenter RDMA networks proposed in our paper . The artifact includes: (1) an NS-3-based network simulator with implementations of ECMP, UCMP, and LCMP routing algorithms; (2) traffic generation tools supporting multiple realistic workload distributions (WebSearch, AliStorage, FbHdp); (3) comprehensive analysis scripts for processing flow completion time (FCT) slowdown and link utilization metrics; and (4) automated batch experiment scripts to reproduce all figures and results presented in the paper. The artifact enables evaluators to verify our key claims about LCMP's performance improvements over state-of-the-art multipathing schemes across various network scales (8 and 13 datacenters), traffic loads (30\%, 50\%, 80\%) and congestion control algorithms (DCQCN, HPCC, TIMELY, DCTCP).

\subsection{Description \& Requirements}

\subsubsection{How to access}   
All code and data of the artifact is publicly available in the following GitHub repository:

\url{https://github.com/[your-username]/LCMP}

A snapshot of this repository is archived at: 

\url{https://zenodo.org/records/xxxx} 

\url{doi:}

The repository is licensed under the MIT License.
For artifact evaluation, evaluators can access the repository directly to configure \& run our code locally.

\subsubsection{Hardware dependencies} 
Our full evaluation was conducted on a dual-socket server with the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item CPU: 2 $\times$ AMD EPYC 7262 8-Core Processor (4+ cores recommended for parallel simulations) 
    \item RAM: 64 GB (8 GB minimum, 16 GB recommended for large-scale experiments)
    \item OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note:} The simulations are CPU-intensive. With the above configuration, experiments can be parallelized across multiple cores to significantly reduce wall-clock time. For systems with fewer cores, experiments will take proportionally longer but can still be run sequentially.


\subsubsection{Software dependencies}    
The artifact requires the following software dependencies:

\textbf{Core Dependencies:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item GCC/G++ 5.x (legacy compiler required for NS-3.18 compatibility)
    \item Python 2.7 (for NS-3 build system)
    \item Python 3.6+ (for traffic generation and analysis scripts)
    \item NS-3.18 network simulator (included in the repository)
    \item Mercurial, CMake, libboost-all-dev
    \item libsqlite3-dev, libxml2-dev, libgtk2.0-dev
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Python Packages (Python 3):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item numpy, pandas, matplotlib (for analysis and plotting)
    \item Standard library modules: argparse, subprocess, csv, os
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Benchmarks}

The artifact includes three realistic datacenter traffic workload distributions (WebSearch, AliStorage2019, FbHdp) used in our experiments.All flow size distributions are provided as CDF files in \texttt{traffic\_gen/flowCDF/} directory. The traffic generator (\texttt{traffic\_gen.py}) uses these distributions to generate synthetic inter-datacenter traffic at specified load levels, simulating realistic RDMA traffic patterns between geo-distributed datacenters.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Set-up}

The artifact requires installation of system dependencies (GCC 5.x, Python 2/3, NS-3 libraries), building the NS-3 simulator, and installing Python packages for analysis scripts. Detailed step-by-step installation instructions are provided in the repository's main README file.

\subsubsection{Major Claims}

The paper makes the following major claims about LCMP:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{(C1): LCMP significantly reduces flow completion time (FCT) slowdown compared to ECMP and UCMP across different traffic loads.} This is demonstrated by experiments (E1, E2, E3) with results shown in Figures 5, 7, and 8 of the paper.
    
    \item \textbf{(C2): LCMP effectively balances link utilization and reduces congestion in long-haul inter-datacenter links.} This is proven by experiment (E0) with results illustrated in Figure 1 of the paper.
    
    \item \textbf{(C3): LCMP is robust across different traffic patterns and workloads.} This is validated by experiment (E4) with results shown in Figure 9 of the paper.
    
    \item \textbf{(C4): LCMP works effectively with different RDMA congestion control algorithms.} This is demonstrated by experiment (E5) with results in Figure 10 of the paper.
    
    \item \textbf{(C5): Each component of LCMP's distributed cost function contributes to overall performance.} This is proven by experiment (E6) with ablation study results shown in Figure 11 of the paper.
    
    \item \textbf{(C6): LCMP maintains its performance advantages in large-scale deployments.} This is validated by experiments (E2, E3) with results in Figures 7 and 8 of the paper.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Experiment (E0): Link Utilization Analysis (Motivation)}

This experiment demonstrates the motivation for LCMP by showing how ECMP and UCMP create imbalanced link utilization in long-haul inter-datacenter links, while LCMP achieves better balance by considering both path characteristics and real-time congestion. This supports claim (C2) and corresponds to \textbf{Figure 1} in the paper.

~\\

\textbf{Experiment (E1): Small-Scale Performance Comparison (8 DCs)}

This experiment compares LCMP, ECMP, and UCMP on an 8-datacenter topology across three traffic loads (30\%, 50\%, 80\%) using DCQCN. This supports claim (C1) and corresponds to \textbf{Figure 5} in the paper.

~\\

\textbf{Experiment (E2): Large-Scale Performance Comparison (13 DCs)} 

This experiment evaluates LCMP scalability on a 13-datacenter geo-distributed topology across three traffic loads. This demonstrates LCMP's capability in large-scale inter-datacenter RDMA networks where centralized control is impractical. This supports claims (C1) and (C6), and corresponds to \textbf{Figure 7} in the paper.

~\\

\textbf{Experiment (E3): Inter-DC Pair Analysis (13 DCs)}

This experiment analyzes performance between specific datacenter pairs (DC1-DC13) in the large-scale topology, focusing on long-haul paths with maximum geographic distance. This validates LCMP's effectiveness for the most challenging inter-datacenter scenarios. This supports claims (C1) and (C6), and corresponds to \textbf{Figure 8} in the paper.

~\\

\textbf{Experiment (E4): Robustness Across Different Workloads}

This experiment evaluates LCMP with different traffic patterns (WebSearch, AliStorage, GoogleRPC). This supports claim (C3) and corresponds to \textbf{Figure 9} in the paper.

~\\

\textbf{Experiment (E5): Robustness Across Different Congestion Control Algorithms}

This experiment tests LCMP with multiple RDMA transport protocols (DCQCN, HPCC, TIMELY, DCTCP). This demonstrates that LCMP's routing-layer improvements are orthogonal to and compatible with various RDMA congestion control mechanisms. This supports claim (C4) and corresponds to \textbf{Figure 10} in the paper.

~\\

\textbf{Experiment (E6): Ablation Study and Cost Function Analysis}

This experiment analyzes the contribution of each component in LCMP's distributed cost function, specifically examining how path costs and congestion costs work together for inter-datacenter routing decisions. This supports claim (C5) and corresponds to \textbf{Figure 11} in the paper.
